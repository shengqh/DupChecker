Description: Meta-analysis has become a popular approach for high-throughput genomic 
  data analysis because it often can signifi-cantly increase power to detect biological 
  signals or patterns in datasets. However, when using public-available databases for 
  meta-analysis, duplication of samples is an often encoun-tered problem, especially 
  for gene expression data. Not remov-ing duplicates would make study results questionable. 
  We de-veloped a Bioconductor package Dupchecker that efficiently identifies duplicated 
  samples by generating MD5 fingerprints for raw data.
